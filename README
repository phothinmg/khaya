ABOUT

This project was conducted for the purpose of learning about calculating of Burmese Calendar dates, JavaScript date objects and time zones.
I did this project as a tutorial while learning Javascript.

BURMESE CALENDAR

The Burmese calendar is a complex and fascinating system that is still used by many people in Myanmar today. It is a unique blend of astronomical observations and mathematical calculations, and it reflects the rich cultural heritage of the Burmese people.

The Burmese calendar does not have a fixed number of days. Leap years can only be used in calendars issued by the government, so it is impossible to plan calendars for the next future  years. Officially published cleandar dates still depend on the National Calendar Advisory Board of Myanmar(Burma).

Yan Naing Aye, (https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=MOmTzIwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) derived the Burmese calendar with the same ease and simplicity as any other calendar, and diligently adhered to the ancient principles. The calendar (https://yan9a.github.io/mmcal/) he created that shows the Burmese days for about 1,500 years.Nowadays, many  Burmese calendar web and mobile applications can be found relying on his algorithm, and this project is the same way. More detail about that read this article => (https://cool-emerald.blogspot.com/2013/06/algorithm-program-and-calculation-of.html).

OUTCOMES FOR MY LEARNING

First of all, I am proud to learn our own calendar system.Until now, our citizens still use our own units of time, weight and volume.

During this project, I had the opportunity to learn about OOP, APIs, and Date Object.  Now that this project is still in progress, there may be some future outcomes.

What I have experienced will be documented on the wiki page of this project.

I would like to thank the people who did the research, who wrote the documentation and articles, because they helped me a lot when I was learning.
