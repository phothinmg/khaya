BURMESE CALENDAR

First, I want to introduce the use of the term Burmese. All those who have lived together for many years in the land of Myanmar are called Myanmar.Most people in Myanmar who practice Buddhism use this calendar.Other religious and ethnic groups also have their own great cultures. Now, if there is anything wrong with the term, it is only due to my lack of experience and knowledge.

The Burmese calendar does not have a fixed number of days. Leap years can only be used in calendars issued by the government, so it is impossible to plan calendars for the next future  years.  Officially published cleandar dates still depend on the National Calendar Advisory Board of Myanmar(Burma).

Yan Naing Aye, (https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=MOmTzIwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) derived the Burmese calendar with the same ease and simplicity as any other calendar, and diligently adhered to the ancient principles. The calendar (https://yan9a.github.io/mmcal/) he created that shows the Burmese days for about 1,500 years.Nowadays, many  Burmese calendar web and mobile applications can be found relying on his algorithm, and this project is the same way. More detail about that read this article ==> (https://cool-emerald.blogspot.com/2013/06/algorithm-program-and-calculation-of.html).
